# btccollect
Collects Public API Information from various BTC Exchanges

Planned:
  - JSON Comparison for new db objects (to help with db size)
  - MongoDB with pymongo
  - Pandas and Monary integration for DataFrames
  - WebSocket (Tornado?)

Project will not be posted here fully and is missing pieces for it to work. Please send me a message to ask about parts not on git if you're interested. I will post a better explanation of all of the classes as they are completed :)
