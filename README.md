# btccollect
Collects Public API Information from various BTC Exchanges and pushes to a mongoDB

Planned:
  - JSON Comparison for new db objects (trades, ob values)(to help with db size)
  - Pandas and Monary integration for DataFrames
  - WebSocket (Tornado?)
  - Graphing?
  
If you happen to stumble on this project, I would love some advice/suggestions!
